I was right away fascinated by it, and so I began taking some online courses and building simple websites using HTML and CSS.",
  "I have recently completed the Front End Development master's program offered by the online training school start2impact, thanks to which I learned and practiced the basics of front end development. This course gave me the opportunity to apply my new knowledge with projects that boosted my creativity and curiosity, while also motivating me to learn and delve deeper into the topics",
