  About:
    "After graduating in Foreign Languages and Cultures at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, I decided to pursue another great passion of mine, web development.\nI've always been interested in computer science and technology, and during my last year of university I started learning the basics of front-end web development on my own. I was right away fascinated by it, and so I began taking some online courses and building simple websites using HTML and CSS.\nI have recently completed the Front End Development master's program offered by the online training school start2impact, thanks to which I learned and practiced the basics of front end development. This course gave me the opportunity to apply my new knowledge with projects that boosted my creativity and curiosity, while also motivating me to learn and delve deeper into the topics.\nThanks to start2impact and my self-study, I have acquired and am continuing to acquire different skills related to web development such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and React, but also soft skills such as creativity, problem solving, precision and proactivity.",
